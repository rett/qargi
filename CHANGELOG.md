## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Six skills behind one `qargi` command: `/qargi-task` (dispatch and session
  lifecycle), `/qargi-project` (the one-time questionnaire), `/qargi-instances`,
  `/qargi-provision`, `/qargi-memory` and `/qargi-review`. `install.sh` installs them at
  user level (skills, subagent, command) or per project (skills and subagent,
  hidden from git through `.git/info/exclude`), as symlinks or copies.
- Named instances, local (a Claude Code subagent in a scratch clone) or cloud (a
  Managed Agents deployment), registered outside every repository with model and
  effort chosen at `init`. Cloud verbs need `--asked`, the user's request naming
  the cloud instance; sessions are tracked, watched by a bounded poller,
  collected into a fresh directory and archived, never deleted. A session budget
  can only be set at creation, so the spend ceiling lives on the deployment
  (`instances budget` changes it).
- The agent contract (one task, own clone, patches back, never push, no backlog)
  and per-repository profiles for gates and rules, kept under the user's config
  directory and inlined into the task block, so nothing qargi related is
  added to a project's committed files.
- Project initialisation (`project template|init|show|list|validate|set`): the
  preliminary questions asked once per project (repository, long-lived branches,
  roles, per-role base branch, push policy, model, effort, packages, Anthropic
  skills, budget, stores), validated and stored. Never push is the default for
  every role; a role that pushes is an explicit answer with a branch pattern that
  cannot match a long-lived branch and, for the agent itself, a credential.
- Provisioning with `ant apply` (`provision plan|apply|add-reference`): plan
  first, create only with the user's go-ahead; model, effort, packages, skills,
  budget and stores come from the stored answers.
- A naming convention: `<project>-<role>-<component>` for agent, environment and
  deployment (roles `dev`, `review`, `docs`, `test`), project-level
  `<project>-memory` and `<project>-reference` stores that are attached rather than
  duplicated, and sessions named `<instance>-<task-slug>`. `instances normalize`
  renames to match and `instances show` reports deviations.
- The canon (`canon/CANON.md`, `canon/layout.json`, version 1, still a draft): the
  standard layout of the two memory stores. Both hold a `/CANON.md` marker, a README,
  `shared/` for every role and `roles/<role>/` with an `INDEX.md` per role; folders
  are named for their scope, with no numbered prefixes. Agents load the README,
  `shared/INDEX.md` and their own role's index, never another role's folder.
- `qargi canon check|plan|apply|import|seed-role|promote|audit`: the reconciler
  brings a store to the current version without losing content (renames keep
  identity and history, conflicts go to `/_conflicts/`, the marker is written last,
  re-runs resume; the legacy layouts and earlier drafts are recognised), imports a
  foreign store such as the old documentation store into a role folder with
  relevant names, writes a role's skeleton, moves a file to `shared/`, and reports
  cross-role writes from the memory version history. `tests/canon_sim.py` proves a
  migration is idempotent and conformant.
- Provisioning creates the project's stores in the canon layout and seeds each
  enabled role's skeleton (`provision/role-seeds/<role>/`); the cloud agent prompt
  names the agent's role and the folders it may load.
- A generic `docs` role skeleton (`provision/role-seeds/docs/`): a contract addendum (accuracy first, profile-defined checks and formats, conflict resolution, history logging), reference files for rules, workflow with the definition of done, per-release sync and review, writing conventions, styling, facts and preferences, and memory files for history and open items, distilled from a working documentation methodology. A role's contract addendum is appended to its agent prompt; `tests/role_seed_sim.py ROLE` proves a role seed conforms to the canon.
- Cross-role content of a project's reference store lives in `shared/` (rules every role follows, the approved example values, architecture, source map, checked facts); a role's folder holds only that role's own.
- Approvals bind to the plan: plans print a token, the matching apply needs `--plan TOKEN` and refuses if the plan changed; every gated verb is appended to an audit log. Sessions without a spend budget are refused.
- Local dispatch has a technical barrier (`qargi local prepare|verify`): a clone of a remote-less bare copy, a credential-less git wrapper, and a comparison of every ref of the real repository and its remote before and after.
- The push policies `coordinator` and `agent` are designed but not built; the project validator refuses them instead of accepting an answer nothing honours. The unused `vault_ids`, `profile` and credential answers were removed.
- Gates have one source of truth, the repository profile; the reference store explains them.
- Canon version 2: both stores use one note format (`Kind`, `Applies to`, `Sources`, and `Check`/`Verified` for the runnable kinds), one index form (`| Path | Purpose | Load |`), a kind vocabulary per store, freshness, size and hygiene rules; `canon check` verifies all of it and `memory lint` is the same check. A version 1 store migrates by adding what a note lacks and never editing a body; imports get the header too; both stores carry a `_template.md`. Reconciler fixes: interrupted migrations resume, maintenance creates missing role indexes, an unrecognised layout is an error. `tests/run.sh` runs the whole suite.
- Private repositories: an optional `repo.credential_file` in the project answers (a token file only you can read, outside every repository). `qargi credential check` proves the token reads and warns if it can also push; a cloud session is created with the repository mounted when a credential is set; `local prepare --repo-url --credential-file` clones a private repository. The token goes to `ant` on stdin or to git through an askpass helper and is in no argument, tracker, audit log or repository; `tests/test_cred.sh` proves it with a fake `ant`.
- The secret rule flags an assignment of a long mixed value, not prose about tokens; the `/home/user/` placeholder is allowed.
- Skills and tools (`/qargi-packs`, `qargi skill|tool ...`): one library with globally unique names, attached by links at four scopes (user, user-role, project, project-role) and opted out per role with `packs_off`. A skill is a directory with `SKILL.md`; a tool is an MCP server with an explicit allowlist and a permission policy per tool (write-like tools cannot run unattended unless marked on purpose). Import takes a local path or a pinned git URL and shows a review (files, scripts, URLs, secret findings) that must be approved with the plan token; any later change is drift and fails `check` and provisioning until `seal`ed. Provisioning attaches a role's packs, and `packs apply INSTANCE` updates an existing cloud agent behind a plan token. `tests/test_packs.sh` covers it offline.
- Commit rules: agents commit change-specific units (a change with its tests, docs and changelog entry), never squash or rewrite, and advise in the manifest and report how the work should be committed (`commit_advice`); the coordinator reviews every patch and applies the commits separately, never squashed, checking that each one builds.
- `qargi instances refresh-prompt NAME`: rebuilds a cloud agent's system prompt from the current preamble, contract and role addendum (shared with provisioning), prints what changes, and applies behind a plan token, so an agent can always be brought back in line after the contract changes.
- Patches travel with their context: agents commit as they go, put the reasoning in each commit message, and return one numbered patch per commit plus `series.md` and `patch_groups` in the manifest (related commits grouped under the change they implement), never one combined patch. `qargi review check RUN_DIR` refuses a monolithic patch, a commit without a message body and a manifest that does not match the patches, and notes commits made in one batch. `tests/test_review.sh` covers it.
- `qargi review check` accepts a review run that returns a report instead of patches: a non-empty `report.md` with a Findings section passes, an empty run or a report without findings is refused. `tests/test_review.sh` covers it.
- Baseline seeds for every role (`provision/role-seeds/<role>/`). `dev` gets real generic guidance (rules, workflow and definition of done by kind of change, gates, conventions for code, tests, user-visible changes and commits, a self-review checklist); `review` and `test` are new, each with a contract addendum (a review returns a report and never edits the project; a test must be seen failing for the right reason, run three times, and never skipped or weakened), reference files, and a memory note (recurring findings, known flaky tests). Every file keeps a marked "Project specifics" slot for what only the repository can say. `tests/role_seed_sim.py` runs for all four roles in the suite.
- The manifest has an `artifacts[]` key for deliverables that are not patches. The review addendum now states that a review has no patches (`commits: []`, the report as an artifact, a scratch CLONE) and the test addendum says where its evidence lives (`fail-first`, `pass` and `stability-N` entries in `gates[]`, ten runs as the floor). The cloud preamble no longer repeats the stores' own load rules.
- Seeds are leaner and have one home per fact: gates, source map and test conventions are `shared/` seeds (`canon seed-role --role shared`, run first by provisioning); a role's rules are not repeated from the contract; placeholder-only files are no longer shipped (the skill lists what to author); the per-file source line and the store-maintenance boilerplate are gone from indexes; the review checklist gains design and readability, the test conventions the test pyramid and assertion messages, the dev conventions secure-coding habits. A project statement replaces the baseline bullet it covers.
- Canon token rules: a note over 10000 characters warns (an agent loads a note whole), an index over 2500 characters warns, what a role loads before it knows its task (README, indexes, notes marked `always`) is at most 8000 characters per store, and an index Load cell must be `always` or a task, never "when unsure", "if needed" or "working on <project>". `canon check` reports each.
- The README seeds are about 40% smaller (the layout diagram the indexes already cover is gone), so a role's up-front load fits the budget with room for its rules.
- The project is named qargi: the command is `qargi`, the skills are `qargi-task`, `qargi-project`, `qargi-instances`, `qargi-provision`, `qargi-memory`, `qargi-packs` and `qargi-review`, the local subagent is `qargi-agent`, the environment variables are `QARGI_*`, and the configuration, state and data directories are named `qargi`.
- Resource names follow `<project>-<component>[-<role>]`: `<project>-agent-<role>`, `<project>-deployment-<role>`, the project-wide `<project>-environment` (shared by the roles, holding the packages of all enabled roles), and the existing `<project>-memory` and `<project>-reference`. Provisioning, `instances normalize` and `show` use the new names; an instance is still `<project>-<role>` and a session `<instance>-<task-slug>`.
- The reconciler keeps the README's list of roles in step with the project's roles when one is added.
- Teams (opt-in, `/qargi-team`): a `lead` and named `teams` in the project answers; a lead role of its own (`PROJECT-agent-lead`, a platform coordinator whose members are the role agents, pinned to their versions, with the team definitions in its prompt); `qargi team brief|check|contract`; a team's outputs are role-prefixed and `collect` splits them per member; the developer owns what ships with the code (manual page, help, completion, `docs/`), the docs role owns the operational docs on its branch. The lead can be this Claude Code session, a cloud lead, or a session started in the console. `qargi hook session-start` loads the lead's READMEs and indexes at the start of a Claude Code session inside a registered project; `qargi memory get` reads a note. The shared environment is reused when a second role is provisioned. `tests/test_team.sh` covers it offline.
- Push grant for the lead (`lead.push` in the project answers; default none). Only the lead ever pushes, members never do. `local`: the Claude Code session leading may push `agent/*` branches and open pull requests without asking each time (the autoload says so, or says to ask before every push); `cloud: branches`: a cloud or console lead may do the same with a fine-grained token file kept outside every repository and different from the read-only repository token. Merges and releases are `ask` (the person confirms each one) or `never`; there is no automatic merge or release, and a branch pattern outside `agent/` is refused. The lead's prompt carries a Push section that grants exactly this, or says it never pushes.
- `review check --allow-empty`: a team member that returns no commits (blocked, or nothing to change) passes `team check`; a single run that claims DONE with no commits still fails.
